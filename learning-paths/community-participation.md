# Learning path: Community participation

See [general learning path info](learning-paths.md)

The community of practice is a great way to learn from others who share the same professional discipline.  The community helps to proliferate better practice and ideas across teams that don't interact regularly.

## Level - Awareness

### Learn which communities exist
- Actively aware of the relevant communities channels, sessions and forums 
- The [cross-government slack team](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) has many communities such as software-development, front-end, security 

### Learn how to get the most from attending events
- Ask questions - there is no such thing as a silly question
- Be open to learning from others, regardless of different levels of experience
- Be aware of externa exist which might be relevant to you
  
## Level - Working

### Learn how to give presentations and talks
This is where you demo something or share an idea with the community through a talk or presentation.  Things to think about:
* Make the title of your talk interesting to attract community members
* A talk could be a short 10 min lightning talk with less preparation or a more in-depth technical session 
* Identify a key message to take away
* Leave time for questions or discussion

#### Talk title ideas

Some talk title templates to inspire you:

```
Why ____ is better than ________

You should stop doing _________ 
Why don't we _____________

______ is overrated
______ is underrated

I messed up _____ and learned ______

Whatever you do, don't ________

I tried _____ and it went ________

I made _____ which is really cool!
```

### Learn how to write blog posts
Writing a blog to share a tool/technique/learning/failure/solution that you've experienced recently. Things to think about:
* If you're not sure whether to blog about a topic - think of a title and ask for opinions first before committing to writing the whole blog
* Learn about how to [write well](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) to interest others and get your points across clearly
* Decide if you want to write an internal blog for just the community or an external blog
* It's ok to ask for feedback before publishing if it helps


## Level - Practitioner

### Learn how to organise community sessions

* If you have an idea but aren't quite sure, ask other developers for their opinion or float the idea on our community chat channel.
* Make the objective of the session clear in advance
* It's ok to ask for help to promote or run a session, thats what the community is for.
* Variation of session types encourages participation.  Consider what types of session have been run recently and what types of session haven't been done for a while to ensure sessions are varied and interesting.
* It's ok to not be the subject matter 'expert'.  The key is to create an environment for discussion and learning, not necessarily teaching others by yourself.  
* Time facilitation skills and asking questions are useful skills to hone.

### Learn how to run deliberate practice sessions
These sessions are where a community group practices a particular task that is typical of our day to day practice.  The principle aim is to learn from each other about different ways of approaching a problem.  Practice could mean using TDD, code review, refactoring, problem decomposition, interface design, mob programming, anything really!
Things to think about:
* Which format might work best - individual / pairing / whole group practice
* Make sure you plan adequate time as practice sessions often take longer than anticipated
* Remember to leave adequate time for sharing and discussion at the end - this is often the most valuable part.
* It's ok to ask for help to run these
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) for small coding problems
* [Kata-log](https://kata-log.rocks/) for library of categorised code katas
* [Refactoring exercises (including front-end)](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/5-coding-exercises-to-practice-refactoring-legacy-code/)

### Learn how to facilitate debates
These sessions are where a community group gets together to hear different perspectives on a particular topic.  It's best to get two opposing views on a subject and let both parties share their views at the start of the session.  The best debate topics are relevant to current work, controversial or provocative, challenging the status quo.  Although any topic can result in an interesting debate.  Again the key here is to facilitate the session by asking questions to help the debate continue, asking for counter responses to statements, pros and cons etc.

- As a group, [watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g) and have a discussion afterwards

### Learn how to host an external speaker
This is when someone does a talk from another community within NICE or external to NICE.  If you're unsure about talk topic ideas just ask for some opinions first 

### Learn how to run a game or workshop
This could be to facilitate better community relationships or with a particular learning objective.  Workshops could be drop in sessions where others bring problems to discuss as a group, for example refactoring/testing/software design workshops.
