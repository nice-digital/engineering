# Systems design


## Level 1 - Awareness
You can assist as part of a team on design of components of larger systems. 

### What this means at NICE 

## Level 2 - Working
You can translate logical designs into physical designs. You can produce detailed designs. You know how to document all work using required standards, methods and tools, including prototyping tools where appropriate. You can design systems characterised by managed levels of risk, manageable business and technical complexity, and meaningful impact. You can work with well understood technology and identify appropriate patterns.

### What this means at NICE 
- You can follow a specification to design the architecture of systems characterised by ***low*** levels of technical challenge and risk.
- You define data schema in collaboration with Data Architect
- You can work with well understood technology on our [technology radar](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar)
- You can document software design using our [agreed diagramming standards](https://nicedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/108331124/Diagrams)

## Level 3 - Practitioner
You can design systems characterised by medium levels of risk, impact, and business or technical complexity. You can select appropriate design standards, methods and tools, and ensure they are applied effectively. You know how to review the systems designs of others to ensure the selection of appropriate technology, efficient use of resources and integration of multiple systems and technology.
