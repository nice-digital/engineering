# Programming and build (software engineering)

You can use agreed security standards and specifications to design, create, test and document new or amended software.

## Level 1 - Awareness

No description available from DDaT

### What this means at NICE 
- You can describe the development standards that we use to build software.

## Level 2 - Working
You can design, code, test, correct and document simple programs or scripts under the direction of others.

### What this means at NICE 

- You have knowledge of a few key technologies on our technology radar and can use these technologies in the correct way with guidance.   This could be [front-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/frontend.md) and/or [back-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/backend.md) with [database](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/databases.md).
- You can build low to medium complexity programs, in line with standards.
- You can write automated tests at the [appropriate level](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/test-at-the-appropriate-level) with guidance from others
- You know how to apply simple code refactorings to reduce complexity
- You are aware of object-oriented software design principles and can apply these with guidance for maintainability and extensibility
- You update documentation in line with agreed standards
- You know how to measure application performance and can make simple performance enhancements

## Level 3 - Practitioner

You collaborate with others when necessary to review specifications and use these agreed specifications to design, code, test and document programs or scripts of medium to high complexity, using the right standards and tools.

### What this means at NICE 

- You have **generalist knowledge of several technologies** on our technology radar and can use these technologies in the correct way. This could be [front-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/frontend.md) and/or [back-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/backend.md) with [database](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/databases.md).
- You can collaborate with testers to build **medium to high complexity** web applications
- You can write automated tests at the [appropriate level](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/test-at-the-appropriate-level) with guidance from others
- You follow the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) when building software
- You can apply complex code refactorings to reduce complexity
test-at-the-appropriate-level).
- You can apply object-oriented software design principles appropriately for maintainability and extensibility
- You can configure efficient pipelines to build, test and deploy code to production
- You monitor key software quality metrics (code coverage, application logs) to maintain appropriate quality across the team
- You can optimise application performance

## Level 4 - Expert

You can advise on the right way to apply standards and methods, ensuring compliance. You can maintain technical responsibility for all the stages and iterations of a software development project. You can provide technical advice to stakeholders and set the team-based standards for programming tools and techniques.

## What this means at NICE 
- You have **specialist knowledge in one or several technologies** on our technology radar and can use these technologies in the correct way.  This could be [front-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/frontend.md) and/or [back-end](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/backend.md) with [database](https://github.com/nice-digital/technology-radar/blob/master/databases.md). You can provide technical advice to stakeholders and set the team-based standards for programming tools and techniques.

- You ensure **compliance** with the [GDS Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice) when building software.

- You can use refactorings to complex legacy code
