# Skill framework for developers

## Principles

* Be simple and clear to use
* Reuse existing skill frameworks as much as possible
* Provide relevant and actionable guidance on skill development
* Open for modification by the team

## Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) framework 

Our framework is based on and extends the DDaT skills framework for software developers. 

## What a software developer does

A software developer designs, runs and improves software that meets user needs. In this role, you will:

* be responsible for writing clean, secure code following a test-driven approach

* create code that is open by default and easy for others to reuse


## Skills required to be a software developer
You will need the following skills for this role, although the level of expertise for each will vary, depending on the role level.

### Relevant skills from the DDaT framework


* ~~Availability and capacity management. You can define, analyse, plan, forecast, measure, maintain and improve all aspects of the availability of services, including power. You control and manage service availability to meet the needs of the business in a cost-effective manner. This includes managing the capability, functionality and sustainability of service components (for example, hardware, software, network resources and software/infrastructure as a service).~~ Proposing this is not relevant - thoughts?

* **Information security**. You maintain the security, confidentiality and integrity of information systems through compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. You design, implement and operate controls and management strategies to allow this.

* **Modern standards approach**. You use a modern standards approach throughout automation and testing.

* **[Programming and build (software engineering)](skills/programming.md)**. You can use agreed security standards and specifications to design, create, test and document new or amended software.

* **Prototyping**. You can apply technical knowledge and experience to create or design workable prototypes, both programs and physical outputs.

* **Systems design**. You can design software with consideration for maintainability, extensibility, performance and security. You can improve the design of a system as it evolves.

* **Systems integration**. You can plan, build and test the integration of software systems.

* **Service support**. You can maintain and support services.

* **User focus**. You understand users and can identify who they are and what their needs are, based on evidence. You can translate user stories and propose design approaches or services to meet these needs and engage in meaningful interactions and relationships with users. You put users first. 

### Additional relevant skills 

* **Community**. You learn from and contribute to the developers community of practice. 

* **Developing others** You help others to develop their skills.
