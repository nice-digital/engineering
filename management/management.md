# Engineering management

## Principles

Here are some things that we believe are important when it comes to engineering management

### Care personally
Build rapport by showing that you care about the wellbeing of your colleagues.  This means recognising the influence of personal life on work life.  Take time to ask how someone's weekend or holiday was, and share your own experiences.  Ask questions but respect privacy and boundaries.  Don't be offended if colleagues don't want to talk about things outside of work.  Recognise and value individual differences and experiences.

### Listen and ask questions
You role is to support your team in finding solutions to their problems.  This means listening to the problems and suggestions from your team.  Let others speak first in meetings before sharing your suggestions.  Give everyone on your team time and encouragement to speak.  Listen and respect differences in opinion.

### Model values
You may not realise that as a manager, others often take a lead from you.  How you behaviour influences others.  Use this as an opportunity for you to model the behaviours that you wish the team to follow too.   If you want to encourage others to ask for feedback, lead by example and first ask for feedback from your team.

### Create a safe environment
Embrace and discuss failure opening with the team. Share your failures and learning experiences.  Encourage debate and find different opinions.  Ask for feedback and criticism on your suggestions

### Challenge directly
It's important to be able to provide feedback whilst keeping the best intentions.  Feedback should be timely, specific and actionable, even if it is a challenging or uncomfortable message to deliver.





## Practices
It's important to listen to the whole engineering team at all levels to understand the problems your staff are facing.  If you only listen to management or seniors then you only get part of the picture.
