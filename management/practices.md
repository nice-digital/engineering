t's important to listen to the whole engineering team at all levels to understand the problems your staff are facing.  If you only listen to management or seniors then you only get part of the picture.


# Engineering management practices


## Self-management
To be an effective manager, this starts with managing yourself effectively.  This includes time management, planning and prioritising your tasks before you can even start delegating work to others

### Learn how to be productive
* Make time to do the hard thing first each day
* Minimise distractions
* Limit your work in progress (WIP), dont do too many things at once


## One to ones

### Key aims
As a manager, you have two basic goals for a 1-1 with a colleague:
* To create a psychologically safe space for individuals to discuss anything with you
* To build a trusting and supportive working relationship

### Good 1-1 practices are:
* Always attend and be on time, this shows you are interested and respect their time.
* A space for your colleague to talk and you to practice 'active listening'
* Provide a way of agenda setting in advance by you or your colleage, this helps to identify and capture topics
* An opportunity to ask questions to further understand or coach through problems
* An opportunity to identify follow up actions for you or your colleague for next one-to-one
* Vary your approach to keep 1-1s fresh and insightful

### Themes
Variety is the spice of life.  Each individual is different and what works for one person isn't necessarily going to work for the next person.  Try varying your approach to one-to-ones to keep discussion fresh.  Here are some ideas to get you started.

#### The initial one
Ask what your colleague wants/needs from a one-to-one.  Tell them what you need from a one-to-one.  Identify practical stuff like best time of day, day of week, duration etc.  

#### Get to know you
Ask them what they like to do outside of work, share what you like to do too.  This will help you to both get to know each other, which is beneficial for relationship rapport building.  It's important to be accepting of individual preferences and differences.  It's also important to respect boundaries here if they don't want to talk.  

#### The question
Think of an open question in advance, thats relevant to the context, and see where the conversation goes. It can be useful to share this question in advance sometimes

#### The personal retro
This is where you ask your colleague whats going well for them at the moment, what are they finding challenging.  Much like a team retrospective, but this should be focussed on them.  You can help them to identify ways to overcome issues they are facing

#### The development review
Ask them how they feel they are progressing with their personal development goals?  What would help them to make more progress? 

#### The one thing
Ask them 'what is one thing that could be better about your job'?  What would make the biggest difference.  What could they do (or you) to help overcome it?

#### The motivation one
Ask them where they are at in the 3 core motivators: impact, autonomy, mastery.  Use the questions below

Making an **IMPACT** as an engineer
* Tell me how the work you're doing is improving outcomes for users?
* Can you speak directly with users, when needed?							
* What successesful user outcomes have your team achieved recently?
* How does the work you're doing help the organisation?	
* Is there anything i can do to help you make more of an impact?

Having **AUTONOMY** as an engineer
* Do you have autonomy to find solutions to problems?
* How do you get to experiment or innovate in your work?
* Are your suggestions for improvements acted upon?
* Do you feel safe to disagree with others?
* Is there anything i can do to help give you more autonomy in your work?

Opportunities for **SKILL MASTERY** as an engineer
* Do you have appropriate opportunities for personal development?							
* Is your work overly repetitive and boring?							
* Do you get actionable feedback to help improve your skills?							
* Are you afraid of making mistakes in your team?							
* Do you feel that you have to ask for permission to try/do new things?							
* Do you understand what career growth paths we have?		
* Is there anything i can do to help you improve your skills?	

#### The feedback one

Ask them if they have any feedback for you.  'What could i do differently that would improve how we work together?' Make sure you listen and discuss more to understand specific examples and the impact of this on them.
