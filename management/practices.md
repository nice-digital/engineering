t's important to listen to the whole engineering team at all levels to understand the problems your staff are facing.  If you only listen to management or seniors then you only get part of the picture.


# Engineering management practices


## Self-management
To be an effective manager, this starts with managing yourself effectively.  This includes time management, planning and prioritising your tasks before you can even start delegating work to others

### Learn how to be productive
* Make time to do the hard thing first each day
* Minimise distractions
* Limit your work in progress (WIP), dont do too many things at once


## One to ones

Create a safe space for each individual on your team to discuss any matters privately with you. Good one to ones are:
* Always attended on time by yourself (manager)
* A space for your colleague to talk and you to listen
* Provide a way of agenda setting in advance by you or your colleage
* An opportunity to ask questions to drive discussion
* An opportunity to identify follow up actions for you or your colleague for next one-to-one
* Typically aim for uncomfortable or challenging (but appropriate) topics

### Themes
Variety is the spice of life.  It's useful to try varying your approach to one-to-ones to keep discussion fresh.  Here are some ideas to get you started.  Everybody has different needs from a one-to-one so 

#### The initial one
Ask what your colleague wants/needs from a one-to-one.  Tell them what you need from a one-to-one.  Identify practical stuff like best time of day, day of week, duration etc.

#### The clean slate
Start with an open question

#### The personal retrospective
This is where you ask your colleague whats going well for them at the moment, what are they finding challenging.  Much like a team retrospective, but this should be focussed on them

### The development review



### One-to-one questions
