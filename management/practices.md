t's important to listen to the whole engineering team at all levels to understand the problems your staff are facing.  If you only listen to management or seniors then you only get part of the picture.


# Engineering management practices


## Self-management
To be an effective manager, this starts with managing yourself effectively.  This includes time management, planning and prioritising your tasks before you can even start delegating work to others

### Learn how to be productive
* Make time to do the hard thing first each day
* Minimise distractions
* Limit your work in progress (WIP), dont do too many things at once


## One to ones

### Key aims
As a manager, you have two basic goals for a 1-1 with a colleague:
* To create a psychologically safe space for individuals to discuss anything with you
* To build a trusting and supportive working relationship

### Good 1-1 practices are:
* Always attend and be on time, this shows you are interested and respect their time.
* Ask a general 'check-in' question to understand where they are at
* A space for your colleague to talk and you to practice 'active listening'
* Provide a way of agenda setting in advance by you or your colleage, this helps to identify and capture topics
* An opportunity to ask questions to further understand or coach through problems
* An opportunity to identify follow up actions for you or your colleague for next one-to-one
* Vary your approach to keep 1-1s fresh and insightful

### Check-in questions
Start each one-on-one meeting with a personal check-in. Knowing the mental state of your team is valuable context for how to proceed in the rest of the meeting.  These questions are important to ask every time, so you can understand how people are doing as far as work-life balance, well-being, and personal life. If something has come up for the individual, allow space to discuss it further. This is where flexibility is key – if you are too focused on getting through a rigid agenda then you might miss cues when your direct reports need support or guidance.

* How have you been this last week?
* What’s on your mind this week?
* Last time we spoke you said X was a challenge for you, how is that going?
* What are your plans and priorities this week?
* Is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about today?

### Themes
Variety is the spice of life.  Each individual is different and what works for one person isn't necessarily going to work for the next person.  Try varying your approach to one-to-ones to keep discussion fresh.  Here are some ideas to get you started.

#### The initial one
If this is your first one to one with someone, this is a good place to start.  Ask what your colleague wants/needs from a one-to-one.  Tell them what you need from a one-to-one.  Identify practical stuff like best time of day, day of week, duration etc. How will you know when they are mad about something? Do they prefer praise in public or private?

#### Get to know you
Ask them what they like to do outside of work, share what you like to do too.  This will help you to both get to know each other, which is beneficial for relationship rapport building.  It's important to be accepting of individual preferences and differences.  It's also important to respect boundaries here if they don't want to talk.  

#### The question
Think of a question in advance thats relevant to the context, and see where the conversation goes. It can be useful to share this question in advance sometimes.  'How do you feel X project is going?'

#### The personal retro
This is where you ask your colleague whats going well for them at the moment, what are they finding challenging.  Much like a team retrospective, but this should be focussed on them.  You can help them to identify ways to overcome issues they are facing

#### The development review
Ask them how they feel they are progressing with their personal development goals?  What would help them to make more progress? 

#### The one thing
Ask them 'what is one thing that could be better about your job'?  What would make the biggest difference.  What could they do (or you) to help overcome it?

#### The motivation one
Ask them where they are at in the 3 core motivators: impact, autonomy, mastery.  Use the questions below

Making an **IMPACT** as an engineer
* Tell me how the work you're doing is improving outcomes for users?
* Can you speak directly with users, when needed?							
* What successesful user outcomes have your team achieved recently?
* How does the work you're doing help the organisation?	
* Is there anything i can do to help you make more of an impact?

Having **AUTONOMY** as an engineer
* Do you have autonomy to find solutions to problems?
* How do you get to experiment or innovate in your work?
* Are your suggestions for improvements acted upon?
* Do you feel safe to disagree with others?
* Is there anything i can do to help give you more autonomy in your work?

Opportunities for **SKILL MASTERY** as an engineer
* Do you have appropriate opportunities for personal development?							
* Is your work overly repetitive and boring?							
* Do you get actionable feedback to help improve your skills?							
* Are you afraid of making mistakes in your team?							
* Do you feel that you have to ask for permission to try/do new things?							
* Do you understand what career growth paths we have?		
* Is there anything i can do to help you improve your skills?	

#### The feedback one

Ask them if they have any feedback for you.  'What could i do differently that would improve how we work together?' Make sure you listen and discuss more to understand specific examples and the impact of this on them.

#### The retention interview one
Instead of holding an 'exit' interview when someone has given notice to leave, hold a 'retention' interview with the aim to actively address any concerns that may progress to someone wanting to move on from a role.  You can ask common exit interview questions, but framed around how to fix issues now, not after someone has already decided to leave
* What would it take to convince you to stay for the next 12 months?
* What do you think we do well here at NICE?
* What do we need to improve here at NICE?

### General 1-1 questions
#### Alignment questions
This is where you want to discuss how connected or aligned an individual feels to the organization. These are particularly important following an engagement survey, or any big change in your organization.

* Do you have any questions about the recent change involving X? (e.g. team change, project change).
* How confident do you feel with where the team/project is going?
* How aligned do you feel with where the team/project is going?
#### Progress questions
It’s important to understand how people feel they are progressing and where they are experiencing growth. This can relate to what they’re learning on the job and whether they are feeling a sense of achievement or momentum.

* What has motivated you in your role [over a period of time]?
* What has challenged you [over a period of time]?
* How challenging is the work you're doing at the moment?
* What has gone well/not so well for you [over a period of time]?
* What’s one thing (or a few) you learned this week?
* Do you feel confident in how you/your team are progressing?
* How are you/your team progressing towards established goals?
* What have you found frustrating at work recently? why?
* What have you really enjoyed at work recently? why?
* If you could change one thing about how we work what would it be?
* How do you feel about the work coming up for you and the team?

#### Relationship-based questions
Interpersonal interactions are often a missed topic when it comes to one-on-ones, but they can have a huge impact on someone’s experience at work. Managers have a great opportunity to coach their team members when it comes to relationships at work.  You can also take this opportunity to ask for feedback on you as a manager and how your relationship is tracking.

* How is everything going with people you work with/on your team?
* Any people interactions you’d like to discuss?
* Do you feel like you get enough feedback on the work you deliver?  What could i do to help improve this?

* What feedback do you have for me?
* How happy are you with how regularly we meet?
* How happy are you with the format of our 1-2-1s?
* Is there anything that you would prefer me to do differently?
* Is there anything that you think i should start doing/do more of?
* Is there anything that you think i should stop doing/do less of?

#### Skill development and career aspiration questions
Often career conversations are reserved for once a year when a review of some sort is done, or completely ignored if a manager doesn’t feel confident in leading the conversation. Career aspirations and goals are important to discuss much more frequently – you can even check-in weekly (i.e. what progress have you made on your career goals this week?).

* When you think about yourself in two years time, what comes to mind?
* How happy are you with your skill development in the last <timeframe>?

* What new skills would you like to learn on the job?
* How are you progressing towards your bigger career and life goals?
* Is there someone in the team/organisation that you’d like to learn from?
* What progress have you made on your career goals/PDP objectives this week?
* What could i do to help with your skill development and personal objectives?

#### Questions to close your one-on-one
Ending your one-on-one meeting on an actionable question keeps the loop of feedback open.

* What are you committing to between now and the next time we meet?
* What can I help you with between now and the next time we meet?
* Is there anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to discuss next time?
