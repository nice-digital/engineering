# The commandments of pair programming
 
- No question is too stupid and **no-one knows everything**!
- **Be kind** - everyone feels self-conscious when they’re being watched and people work in different ways
- **Finding a solution is only part of the goal** - share knowledge, build rapport, talk!
- **Disable notifications**! Respect your pairing partner’s time
- **Keep a clean desk**- nobody likes a hairy keyboard
- If you know what to do, **let the other person type**
- Agree on **regular breaks** and feel free to request one
- **Don’t hog the keyboard** - switch regularly
- Think out loud! **No speaky, no typey**
- **Regularly check understanding** and stop to explain
- Typos and pseudo-code are **fine to get your point across**
- Hit a brick wall? **Get a third opinion!**
- When you’re done, **reflect on what you’ve achieved** (or not!). What might make it easier next time?
