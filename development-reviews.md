Development reviews are intended to help establish career developmet plans for the next 12 month period. Some key differences over past PDP/Appraisals you may have experienced at NICE: 
* We have a new form from HR - My Contribution - with new guidance
* We will be using a [skill competency framework](skill-framework/README.md) for:
  * Reviewing current skills levels against expectations
  * Planning skill development based on ambitions

## Developers - How to prepare for your own development review

* You should have a meeting invite from your line manager for your development review including a few documents including:
  * My Contribution form
  * Employee's guidance document - read this first before continuing with this guidance
* Fill in the sections 1, 2 and 3 in the My Contribution form
* For section 4: Aspirations
  * Select your current levels of competency using the [develop your skills app](https://nice-digital.github.io/develop-your-skills) along with your target role (If you want to develop your skills in your existing role then just select this as your target role)
  * Copy the link from the browser and store it in your form in the Reflections/comments box for reference
* For section 5: Development objectives
  * Review the development plan suggested by the develop your skills application.  This should give you indication of areas to develop.
* Fill in section 6 by yourself
* You're now ready for your development review meeting with your line manager   

## Developers - What NOT to do with your development review

* Don't turn up to the meeting with an empty form
* Don't just turn up with your own feedback - 360 feedback is important


## Managers - How to prepare for someone elses development review

* Read the Managers guidance document from the NICE intranet
* Arrange a 2 hour meeting with your team member, give them at least 1 full weekâ€™s notice to prepare.  The invite should include:
  * Make sure you attach the My Contribution form and the Employee's guidance from the NICE intranet
  * A link to the guidance section above for 'How to prepare for your own development review'
* Review the expected [skill competencies](https://nice-digital.github.io/develop-your-skills/#/framework) for the team member's current role.
* Write down any feedback you may have in relation to their current levels of competence and the expectations for their current role.
  * Remember to highlight areas that they are working at or above the expected level of competency
  * Highlight a few key prioritised areas for development
* Write down any other positive or constructive feedback you may have for them that you feel is relevant but not captured by the core competencies
* Bring feedback to meeting
  
## Managers - What NOT to do for someones development review
* Forget to prepare any feedback for your team member
* Be overly negative and critical
