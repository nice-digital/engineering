# Guidance for all developers

## IMPORTANT 

Your development plan is yours, not your managers or anyone elses.  It should capture your ambitions for your where you want to take your career. Don't worry if you don't meet skill expectations for your current role, you will **not** be penalised for this. We are just starting out with a skill competency framework and this sets out where we want to get to and should be useful in skill development planning.


## How to prepare for your own development review

* Ask for 360 feedback from your colleagues. Make a copy of this [360 feedback MS forms template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=efQwYEKzLUel3XQP91ON6b2B0Lj6-KRFi79WhBUXfkRUQkEyQVhYUEREVlo3TjhRU1FaUjk3OUhHMy4u&sharetoken=owNj6Zi0WKRM8432LUCT) and share with the people you work closely with. Do this first so that people have time to provide feedback (give them a week before your review if you can). Multiple perspectives are more useful than one perspective. You should be seeking feedback from your manager and some of the people that you've worked with, including from people working in related disciplines. Open and direct peer feedback is encouraged but there is also an option to provide confidential feedback via a line manager, should there be a need.
* Create yourself a confluence page in the [DEV space](https://nicedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/overview) using the 'Career development plan - software developer' template.  Call your page 'Career development plan - ${Firstname} ${Lastname}'.
* Click the padlock icon in the top right and make this page only visible to yourself and your line manager.
* Fill in your career development plan page yourself (plan a couple of hours for this)
  * The form is self explanatary but you can read the NICE HR's [Employee's guidance](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92191/view/Employee%20Guidance.docx) and [Employee step-by-step](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92091/view/Employee%20step%20by%20step%20guide.docx) from NICE Intranet. (NOTE we're using confluence template, not the My Contribution word document ,but its very similar).
* Share the form and any 360 feedback with your manager in advance of your development review meeting (if you can)


## What to do at the meeting
* Read the [Employee's guidance](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92191/view/Employee%20Guidance.docx) from the NICE intranet for guidance on what to do at the review meeting
* Discuss your 360 feedback and development plan with your manager, they may make suggestions.
* Work with your manager to identify an appropriately challenging stretch objective for yourself

## What to do after the meeting
* Check that you are happy with your development plan, if not, continue discussions with your manager

## What NOT to do with your development review
* Don't turn up to the meeting with an empty form.  It's important that you have a go at filling it in as it's your plan.  But any questions feel free to ask questions in advance
* Don't turn up with no feedback from anyone
* Don't come up with a plan and then hide it away for 12 months.  Progress will come from regular feedback and review conversations

# 3 month reviews
* you'll be having a conversation about your development plan with your line manager every 3 months going forward to ensure a regular conversation happens and you get the opportunities and support you need
