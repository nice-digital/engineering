# Guidance for all developers and testers

## IMPORTANT 

Your personal development plan is yours to own, not your managers.  It should capture your career ambitions and personal goals, in the context of the goals we have to achieve as an organisation. 


## How to prepare for your own development review


1. **A week before - if you want 360 feedback, send 360 feedback survey to your colleagues**. Make a copy of this [360 feedback MS forms template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=efQwYEKzLUel3XQP91ON6b2B0Lj6-KRFi79WhBUXfkRUQkEyQVhYUEREVlo3TjhRU1FaUjk3OUhHMy4u&sharetoken=owNj6Zi0WKRM8432LUCT) by clicking the duplicate button.  Then share with the people you work closely with. Do this first so that people have time to provide feedback (give them a week before your review if you can). Multiple perspectives are more useful than one perspective. You should be seeking feedback from your manager and some of the people that you've worked with, including from people working in related disciplines. Open and direct peer feedback is encouraged but there is also an option to provide confidential feedback via a line manager, should there be a need.   Feedback is captured anonymously by default.  
2. **Create a new development review confluence page.** Create yourself a confluence page in the [DEV space](https://nicedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/overview) using the 'Career development plan - software engineering team 2022' template.  Call your page 'Career development plan - ${Firstname} ${Lastname} - ${currentYear}'.
3. **Make it private**. Click the padlock icon in the top right and make this page only visible to yourself and your line manager.
4. **Fill in the page** Fill in your career development plan page yourself (plan a couple of hours for this)
5. **Share with your manager** Share the form (and any 360 feedback) with your manager in advance of your development review meeting (if you can)


## What to do at the meeting
* Talk through your development plan with your manager, they may make suggestions on your objectives.

## What to do after the meeting
* Check that you are happy with your development plan, if not, continue discussions with your manager

## What NOT to do with your development review
* Don't turn up to the meeting with an empty form.  It's important that you have a go at filling it in as it's your plan.  But any questions feel free to ask questions in advance
* Don't see this as a 'once a year' conversation.  Progress will come from regular reviews and adapting objectives as the year unfolds

# Quarterly month reviews
* It's advised to have a conversation about your development plan with your line manager every 3 months going forward to ensure a regular conversation happens and you get the opportunities and support you need.  This can just be at a regular 1-1.
