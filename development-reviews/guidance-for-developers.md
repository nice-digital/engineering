# Guidance for all developers

## IMPORTANT 

Your development plan is yours, not your managers or anyone elses.  It should capture your ambitions for your where you want to take your career. Don't worry if you don't meet skill expectations for your current role, you will **not** be penalised for this. We are just starting out with a skill competency framework and this sets out where we want to get to and should be useful in skill development planning.


## How to prepare for your own development review

* Ask for [360 feedback from your colleagues](https://nice-digital.github.io/develop-your-skills/#/feedback).  Multiple perspectives are more useful than one perspective. You should be seeking feedback from your manager and some of the people that you've worked with. 
* Create yourself a confluence page in the [DEV space](https://nicedigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/overview) using the 'Career development plan - software developer' template.  Call your page 'Career development plan - ${Firstname} ${Lastname}'.
* Click the padlock icon in the top right and make this page only visible to yourself and your line manager.
* Fill in your career development plan page yourself. 
  * The form is self explanatary but you can read the NICE HR's [Employee's guidance](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92191/view/Employee%20Guidance.docx) and [Employee step-by-step](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92091/view/Employee%20step%20by%20step%20guide.docx) from NICE Intranet. (NOTE we're using confluence template, not the My Contribution word document ,but its very similar).

* Share the form and any 360 feedback with your manager in advance of your development review meeting (if you can)
* Discuss your feedback and development plan with your manager at your development review meeting


## What NOT to do with your development review

* Don't turn up to the meeting with an empty form.  It's important that you have a go at filling it in as it's your plan.  But any questions feel free to ask questions in advance
* Don't turn up with no feedback from anyone
