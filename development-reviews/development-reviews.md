Development reviews are to:
 
* reflect on what's gone well for you personally at NICE over the last 12 months, and what's been challenging 
* identify your longer term career ambitions
* understand how your personal development goals align to and support the NICE delivery goals for the next 12 months
* plan your career development priorities for the next 6 to 12 months 

## Key points to note from last year
Some key points to note: 
 
* We'll still be storing development plans in confluence, not word documents like the rest of NICE.  This is because we're not officially meant to be using OneDrive yet for document storage and its easier to access and collaborate on confluence pages then it is emailing word documents around.  The form we'll be using is a simplified version of the 'My Contribution' word document that can be found on the NICE Space intranet. (There is an updated confluence page template 'Career development plan - software engineering team - 2023' in the Dev COP confluence space)
* For software developers we have an updated [skill competency framework](https://niceuk-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/james_kirk_nice_org_uk/ETtFM-cqCH9Krsm_aGe8NQkB6Mttmb3cpYYqIFVTYVjOhg?e=K7HMRZ) to help understand expectations across job levels and assist with career planning, if you find this useful.
* If you want to do 360 feedback, we're still using the Microsoft Forms template.
