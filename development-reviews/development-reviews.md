Development reviews are to:
* reflect on your strengths and areas for improvement over the last 12 months  
* reflect on your ambitions
* plan your career development for the next 12 months 

## Key differences
Some key differences over past PDP/Appraisals you may have experienced at NICE: 

* We will be using a [skill competency framework](../skill-framework/skill-framework.md) for:
* We have two tracks: technical and management at lead developer level
* We recognise ambitions to get better in your current role or to work towards a different role
* We have a new form to support the review process
* Structured 360 feedback will play a larger part of reviews.  This means asking your manager, your close colleagues and your line supports for feedback.  This is to ensure feedback is fair, multi-directional and more effective at planning skill development than feedback from just your line manager
