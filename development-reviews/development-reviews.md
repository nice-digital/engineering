Development reviews are to:
* reflect on your strengths and areas for improvement over the last 12 months  
* reflect on your ambitions
* plan your career development for the next 12 months 

## Key differences
Some key differences over past PDP/Appraisals you may have experienced at NICE: 

* We will be using a [skill competency framework](../skill-framework/skill-framework.md) for:
  * Reviewing current skills levels against skill level expectations
  * Planning skill development based on ambitions
* We have two tracks: technical and management at both senior and lead levels
* We recognise ambitions to get better in your current role or to work towards a different role
* We have a new form to support the review process
* Development plans should be only contain skill development objectives.  Objectives relating to specific project deliverables should NOT be in development plans and should be tracked via established team processes (JIRA boards).  This is for consistency and visibility
* Structured 360 feedback will play a larger part of reviews.  This means asking your manager, your close colleagues and your line supports for feedback.  This is to ensure feedback is fair, multi-directional and more effective at planning skill development than feedback from just your line manager
