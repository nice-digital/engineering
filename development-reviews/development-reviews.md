Development reviews are to:
* reflect on your strengths and areas for improvement over the last 12 months  
* reflect on your ambitions
* plan your career development for the next 12 months 

## Key differences from last time
Some key differences over appraisals/development reviews from last year: 

* For software developers, there is a [skill competency framework](../skill-framework/skill-framework.md) that we'll be using for reference.  Although this won't be the basis for 360 feedback this year (see next point)
* The 360 feedback survey has changed and is not a Microsoft Forms template for you to copy and send out.  We're still using 360 feedback as this is to ensure feedback is fair, multi-directional and more effective at planning skill development than feedback from just your line manager.
