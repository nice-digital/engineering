Development reviews are to:
* reflect on your strengths and areas for improvement over the last 12 months  
* reflect on your ambitions
* plan your career development for the next 12 months 

## Key differences from last time
Some key differences over appraisals/development reviews from last year: 

* We'll be storing development plans in confluence, not word documents like the rest of NICE.  This is because its easier to access and collaborate on confluence pages then it is emailing word documents around.  The form we'll be using is essentially the same as the 'My Contribution' word document that can be found on the NICE Space intranet.
* HR have introduced a new section on 'Values and behaviours'.
* For software developers, remember that we have the [skill competency framework](https://nice-digital.github.io/develop-your-skills/#/framework) that can be useful for planning skill development and showing whats expected at each level of developer from apprentice through to lead.  Although we won't be using this for 360 feedback this year.
* The 360 feedback survey has changed and is now an anonymous Microsoft Forms template for you to copy and send out.  We're still using 360 feedback as this is to ensure feedback is fair, multi-directional and more effective at planning skill development than feedback from just your line manager.
