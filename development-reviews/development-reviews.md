Development reviews are to:
 
* Self-reflect on your past year at NICE and think about your future and a plan for the next 12 months.
* reflect on what's gone well for you personally at NICE over the last 12 months, and what's been challenging 
* identify your longer term career ambitions
* understand how your personal development goals align to and support the NICE delivery goals for the next 12 months
* plan your career development priorities for the next 6 to 12 months 

## Key points to note from last year
Some key points to note: 
 
* For software developers we have an updated [skill competency framework](https://niceuk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/DIT_Engineering/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B44b57b0a-efe7-45f8-9960-0aa5b977cf47%7D&action=view) to help understand expectations across job levels and assist with career planning, if you find this useful.
* 360 feedback is optional but recommended (see guidance for doing your own development review)
