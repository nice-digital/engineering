## How to prepare for someone else's 12 month development review

* Arrange a development review meeting with your line support, 1.5 hours and give at least a whole week for them to prepare for it.
* Write down any feedback you may have your colleague, providing specific examples where you can

## What to do at the meeting
* Encourage them lead the meeting and walk you through their form and point out any key discussion points.  Keep an eye on the time and allow time to reflect on the past year, and also to discuss future objectives.
* Make sure you discuss positives as well as areas for improvement.
* Assess the relevancy of the objectives against the delivery plan goals for this year for your team

## What to do after the meeting
* Check that you and your line support are happy with their development plan
* Check you've added any relevant comments on your line supports development plan page at the bottom
* Export your line supports development plan as PDF and email to hradvice

## Managers - What NOT to do for someones 12 month development review
* Remember that its their development plan, not yours.  This means they should play a large part in coming up with suggested personal objectives, so listen to their suggestions first before suggesting your own ideas.

## 3 month development reviews
* As a manager it's your responsibility to check up with your line supports to see how they are getting on and see if there is anything you can help to enable their development.  You should be aiming to have 1 development review conversation every 3 months minimum.
