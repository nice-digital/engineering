## How to prepare for someone else's 12 month development review

* Read the [Managers guidance document](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92181/view/Manager's%20Guidance.docx) from the NICE intranet
* You should have an invitation for a development review meeting with your line support
* **Feedback** - Your line support should have sent you an email asking for 360 feedback against their core competencies.  Provide specific feedback where you can.
  * Highlight strengths and areas for development based on core skills
  * Add any other positive or constructive feedback you may have for them that you feel is relevant but not captured by the core competencies
* Send this back to them in advance of the review meeting
* We encourage open, direct feedback but if you've been sent any confidential feedback about your line support, gather this for the meeting 

## What to do at the meeting
You are essentially reviewing their 360 feedback and development plan, helping to discuss and agree appropriate development objectives.

* Follow the guidance in the [Managers guidance document](http://space.nice.org.uk/sorce/beacon/dmdr/92181/view/Manager's%20Guidance.docx) from the NICE intranet for guidance on how to behave at the meeting
* Review their 360 feedback to identify strengths and areas for development
  * Remember to share any anonymous confidential feedback you've received from others
* Discuss how relevant and achievable the objectives are in their development plan.  Help to identify a stretch objective that will challenge them appropriately in relation to their development ambitions.  Make sure you both agree the objectives are appropriate for now.

## What to do after the meeting
* Check that you and your line support are happy with their development plan
* Check you've added any relevant comments on your line supports development plan page at the bottom
* Export your line supports development plan as PDF and email to hradvice

## Managers - What NOT to do for someones 12 month development review
* Don't forget to prepare any feedback for your team member
* Don't be overly negative and critical.  Find some positives too

## 3 month development reviews
* As a manager it's your responsibility to check up with your line supports to see how they are getting on and see if there is anything you can help to enable their development.  You should be aiming to have 1 development review conversation every 3 months minimum.
